## Code-generation

The project comes with code creation to speed things up.

**Routes**

`npm run create route MyNewRoute` or `yarn run create route MyNewRoute`

This will create 
```
├── containers
|   ├── MyNewRoute (New)
    |   ├── MyNewRouteContainer.js
    |   ├── MyNewRouteScreen.js
    |   ├── my-new-route.scss
└── ... other route containers
```

also import the route and add an entry in `routes` array of `/src/config/routes.js`

**Components**

`npm run create component MyNewComponent` or `yarn run create component MyNewComponent`

This will create 
```
├── components
|   ├── MyNewComponent (New)
    |   ├── MyNewComponent.js
    |   ├── MyNewComponent.stories.js
    |   ├── my-new-component.scss
└── ... other components
```

## TODO
- Flow name mapper (not working)
- UI testing
- App alerts (success, error)
